# Airport Advisor


## Background and Overview

Flying can be a very stressful experience.  

Oftentimes, travelers may find it much easier if they have information on the services of the airport they are visiting before they travel. Airport Advisor allows travelers to get useful information from fellow travelers about the airports they are going to visit, as well as share their own experiences.  

The site will feature easy searching and navigation so a user can view ratings on different categories. Users may also help others by reviewing airports as well.

## Functionality & MVP

- [ ] Search bar with autofill that allows you to search airport by name and airport IATA code
- [ ] Users can leave a review, along with ratings, and view others' reviews and ratings
- [ ] Filter for reviews based on keywords
Bonus
- [ ] Display of airport related data (for example, nearby hotels or restaurants)

## Technologies & Technical Challenges

### Backend: Node, Express, MongoDB

For the backend, we will be using a Node server that utilizes the Express framework for routing and mongoDB for storing data.

### Frontend: React, Redux, Trip Advisor API

For the frontend, we will be using React and Redux as our main frameworks and will be utilizing the Trip Advisor API for displaying various data for information we will not be storing in our backend.

### Technical challenges we will face include:

Parsing the large amount of airport data that we will have stored on the backend

### UI/UX


Write what is happining when you go the side and click stuf!!
<!-- Like this: -->
<!-- The goal is to make a sleek and intuitive interface for users to be able to pick up and engage with quickly. Pages will be self explanatory with a minimal feel as to not overwhelm users.

The app will consist of a single page upon logging in with a welcome banner and a sidebar that can be used for navigation between different document rooms. The sidebar will collapse upon entering a document room for a full-screen experience with a clickable tab to reopen the sidebar in order to navigate elsewhere.

Document pages will start out as a blank canvas and include a toolbar to switch between text and drawing modes with their own prospective editing tools such as font size and pen width.

The top of the screen will feature an unobtrusive fixed bar for document information such as name and creator, a log out button, and links to the GitHub repository as well as a dropdown menu with links to each contributing developer's information. -->
